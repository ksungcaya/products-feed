This program also introduced the interval timing and user modeling technology \n      that eliminates looking at keys, assures correct fingering, and trains \n      writing skills. </p>\n<p class=\"SpacedParagraph\">Today, Ainsworth &amp; Partners offers two complete software systems focusing on <a href=\"Typing%20Tutor.htm\">keyboard \n  training</a> and <a href=\"Number%20Keypad.htm\">number keypad training</a>. Our exclusive <a href=\"HandsON.htm\">Hands-On!</a> software continuously monitors hand position during typing lessons or \n        drills and warns instantly if hands are not on the home row keys. This \n        eliminates the major reason people look at the keyboard when learning \n        to type. Instead of covering the keyboard or using continuous finger diagrams \n      and other visual distractions, our software avoids &quot;home row&quot; problems through better instructional design.</p>\n<p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"AdaptiveLessons.htm\">Adaptive lessons</a> measure individual dexterity and automatically set the pace of the lessons \n        to match each person - from students with special needs to adults. The \n        software senses these subtle differences and sets a pace that's ideal \n        for each person. This allows anyone to learn to type accurately and well, \n        at whatever speed is appropriate.</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\">After the correct fingering is mastered, <a href=\"PrescriptionDrills.htm\">Prescription \n        Drills</a> eliminate even minor hesitations and any tendency to \n        glance down at the keyboard. Slower keys are detected and corrected automatically \n        with tailored computer-generated exercises. The goal is to create on-screen \n        composition skills that allow people to write as fast and as well as they \n        think.</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\">Our <a href=\"Typing%20Games.htm\">typing games</a> are far more than just entertainment. The Type-Oh! games may be combined \n        with lessons and drills at any time for additional practice, for speed \n        building, or just as an alternate way to learn. We use keyboard data from \n        the games to identify and automatically correct even minor hesitations \n        that will later interfere with writing and composition.</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"Typing%20Test.htm\">Typing \n        tests</a> evaluate and document progress with our test materials \n        or yours. Our exclusive Best Performance Index measures actual proficiency \n        in addition to reporting speed and accuracy scores. Your custom tests \n        can be added at any time. <a href=\"Reports.htm\">Reports</a> are also available on demand for \n        printout and for instructor or student review.</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"Typing%20to%20Write.htm\">Typing to write</a> enrichment programs expand keyboarding beyond simply typing to include \n        on-screen composition and writing skills. Both programs below are included \n        in the Ainsworth Keyboard Trainer:</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"ConversationPiece.htm\">Conversation Piece</a> trains typing \n          and thinking at the same time. This interactive, on-screen typed conversation \n          is highly personal and fun. This program elevates typing from copying \n          text to expressing ideas and focusing on content.</p>\n        <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"AinsworthWriter.htm\">Ainsworth Writer</a> is a simplified \n          word processor created specifically for beginning writers. With this \n          self-teaching program, students can easily create and print documents \n          as part of a keyboarding class. A short writing course is included.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <hr align=\"left\" width=\"642\" />\n<p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"Installation Guide.htm\">Installation Guide</a> covers all the \n        technical details - including networking, distance learning via the Internet, and site licensing \n        for any Windows system. Our standard network installation also supports \n        terminal servers  and similar  networks.</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"Instructors%20Guide.htm\">Instructors \n        Guide</a> offers suggestions for both keyboard training and number keypad \n        training in the classroom.</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><a href=\"KeyboardManager.htm\">Manager Software</a> gives the classroom instructor complete tools for creating and \n        evaluating keyboarding and number keypad classes.</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\">&nbsp;</p>\n      <p class=\"SpacedParagraph\"><span class=\"SpacedParagraph\">www.qwerty.com<span style=\"Font-Size : 14px\"><img\n\t\t\tsrc=\"spacer.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\" align=\"bottom\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"11\" /></span>&copy; 2014 Ainsworth &amp; Partners, Inc.<span style=\"Font-Size : 14px\"><img\n\t\t\tsrc=\"spacer.gif\" width=\"8\" height=\"8\" alt=\"\" align=\"bottom\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"11\" /></span>ainsworth@qwerty.com</span></p>\n    </div>\n</div></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n"

In addition to delivering Kaspersky\ns award-winning anti-malware technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT adds mobile security, file server security and flexible control technologies that help you to ensure compliance with your security policies.\r\nDeeper protection for your business\n its data\n and its reputation\nKaspersky\ns anti-malware technologies deliver multi-layer defences to protect your systems and sensitive business data from today\ns increasingly sophisticated threats. With a combination of signature-based, proactive and cloud-enabled technologies \n plus special features including our Network Attack Blocker and two-way firewall \n Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT does more to keep your business secure.\r\nPreventing the spread of malware via shared storage\nA single infected file on one of your servers has the potential to affect every computer on your corporate network \n and that can severely damage business productivity. Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT includes essential anti-malware for file servers \n to protect servers running Microsoft Windows, Linux and Novell NetWare against malware.\r\nEnabling mobile access and secure BYOD\nMulti-level mobile security technologies help you to defend your business against the security risks that can result from enabling mobile access to your corporate systems. Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT, can help you to benefit from the cost savings and productivity gains that a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) initiative can deliver \n while Kaspersky technologies protect you against viruses, spyware, Trojans, worms, bots and a wide range of other threats.\r\nSaving time and money \n by simplifying mobile management\nWith integrated mobile security and mobile device management (MDM), Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT makes it easier to control how mobile devices access your business systems. As soon as a mobile device appears on your network, it\ns visible to your administrators \n so they can rapidly start managing the device\ns security and how the device interacts with your systems.\r\nPowerful control tools \n to help you enforce your security policies\nKaspersky\ns Application Control, Device Control and Web Control technologies help to deliver a much deeper level of defence for your data and systems \n so your IT team can easily control how applications run and manage how employees use the web and removable devices. Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT helps you to enforce your corporate security policies \n across your business and your workforce.\r\nPreconfigured for immediate protection\nAs soon as Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT is installed on your corporate network, Kaspersky technologies are ready to start protecting your business.

Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT combines our latest signature-based, proactive and cloud-assisted technologies \n to deliver superior anti-malware protection for your business.\r\nMore frequent updates\nCompared with many other vendors, Kaspersky updates its malware database much more frequently \n to help ensure you\nre protected against the very latest threats. In addition, by using pattern-based signatures, Kaspersky improves detection rates \n while also reducing the size of the signature updates that your systems receive. By optimising updates, Kaspersky helps to minimise the load placed on your computing resources.\r\nUrgent Detection System (UDS)\nEven before a new malware signature can be released, Kaspersky\ns Urgent Detection System database is updated with information about newly discovered malware \n to help deliver even earlier protection against new threats.\r\nSystem Watcher\nWhen a program is launched on one of your systems, Kaspersky\ns System Watcher will start analysing the program\ns behaviour. If suspicious behaviour is detected, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business SELECT will block the program and \n if any malicious activity has occurred \n you can \nroll-back\n your system to an earlier state before the problem arose.\r\nActive Disinfection\nWorking at the lowest levels of an operating system, Kaspersky\ns Active Disinfection technology neutralises malicious objects.\r\nDeeper levels of protection\nKaspersky\ns Active Disinfection technology works at the lowest levels of a computer\ns operating system \n to protect against malicious code.\r\nCloud-assisted protection\nMillions of consenting users have \nopted in\n to enable the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) to collect information about potential malware and suspicious behaviour on their systems.
