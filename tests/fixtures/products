Endpoint Security for Business Core delivers:
- Rigorous, multi-layer anti-malware protection;
- Single, unified anti-malware management console.
With over 125,000 new malicious programs being detected every day, relying on just signature-based protection is no longer enough to provide adequate security for your business Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE combines several powerful anti-malware technologies 
 including signature-based protection, proactive protection and cloud-assisted security 
 to deliver multiple layers of defence for your business.
Superior anti-malware
By combining signature-based detection, plus pattern-based, proactive defences and cloud-assisted technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business provides greatly enhanced detection of malware 
 including protection against new threats that have not yet been recorded in signature databases.
Protects your systems from hacker attacks
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall 
 together with our Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) 
 helps to protect workstations and servers on your network
 to prevent intruders from accessing your systems and stealing or corrupting your business data.
Millions of other users
 all helping to protect your business
Many millions of Kaspersky users have 
opted in
 to let the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) automatically gather information about possible malware infections or suspicious behaviour from their systems. Over 25 million samples are received each day and this unparalleled level of intelligence from the field 
 received in real-time 
 enables Kaspersky
s experts to analyse new IT security threats and provide solutions more rapidly. Your business can fully benefit from this cloud-assisted capability
 even without you having to opt in.
Rapid to deploy
 and easy to manage
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE is preconfigured to start protecting your systems and data
 as soon as it
s installed. It
s also supplied complete with Kaspersky Security Center 
 the centralised management console that makes it easier for you to control all aspects of your Kaspersky security solution.
Flexible and scalable
You can tailor your Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE solution to meet your specific IT security needs. By adding one or more Kaspersky Targeted Security Solutions, you can add fully-integrated protection for storage, virtualisation, file servers, mobile devices, mail, Internet gateways or collaboration
 plus wide-ranging systems management capabilities.
Furthermore, whichever Kaspersky Targeted Security Solution you choose, you
ll still be able to manage your entire Kaspersky security via one integrated management console 
 Kaspersky Security Center.
In addition to award-winning anti-malware protection technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE also includes features that help to ease the load on your IT team.
Anti-malware for Workstations
Automatic and on-demand scanning
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business automatically scans files whenever they
re created, launched or modified. You can also run scans on demand 
 for individual files, directories, local disks or network disks.
Active Disinfection
Kaspersky Active Disinfection technology operates at the lowest levels of an operating system, to neutralise malicious objects.
Frequent updates and signature-based protection
Kaspersky issues malware database updates on a much more frequent basis than many other vendors. In addition, the use of pattern-based signatures helps to improve the detection of malicious files and also reduce the size of signature updates. Update optimisation helps to minimise the load on your CPUs, hard drives and communications bandwidth 
 so more of your computing resources are available for your business-critical applications.
Urgent Detection System
Kaspersky
s Urgent Detection System (UDS) database is updated with information about new malware before a signature has been created 
 to provide early and effective protection against new IT security threats.
Behavioural Analysis
Kaspersky
s System Watcher feature provides proactive protection, by analysing each program as the program is launched. It blocks the program if any suspicious behaviour is detected and it can also 
roll-back
 the system to a point before the malicious activity occurred.
Cloud-based protection
By gathering information about suspicious behaviour from millions of 
opted-in
 participants
 systems, the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) provides a more rapid response to new threats. Third-party tests show that KSN
s response time can be as fast as 0.02 seconds. In addition, KSN helps to reduce the risk of 
false positives
 
 to help ensure that only malicious software is identified
 so there
s less disruption to your day-to-day business activities.
Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) with Personal Firewall
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall protects endpoints from network threats, by controlling inbound and outbound traffic 
 according to the port, IP address, the application that is generating the traffic or other parameters. With predefined rules for over 250 of the most commonly used applications, Kaspersky also helps you to reduce the time taken to configure your firewall protection.
Network Attack Blocker
Network Attack Blocker tracks suspicious network activity. If an attempted attack is detected, Network Attack Blocker responds according to pre-defined criteria.
Unified Management Console
Centralised management console
Kaspersky Security Center is a centralised management console that makes it easier for administrators to set protection parameters, manage anti-malware updates and monitor security across their IT network.
Efficient use of your IT resources
Because the same Kaspersky team has developed all of Kaspersky
s prime technologies, your entire Kaspersky security solution is tightly integrated 
 for superior performance and easier management 
 and it places less load on your computing resources.
Support for a range of platforms
Kaspersky has developed endpoint security applications for Windows, Macintosh and Linux 
 so it
s easier for administrators to protect diverse networks.

Endpoint Security for Business Core delivers:
- Rigorous, multi-layer anti-malware protection;
- Single, unified anti-malware management console.
With over 125,000 new malicious programs being detected every day, relying on just signature-based protection is no longer enough to provide adequate security for your business Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE combines several powerful anti-malware technologies 
 including signature-based protection, proactive protection and cloud-assisted security 
 to deliver multiple layers of defence for your business.
Superior anti-malware
By combining signature-based detection, plus pattern-based, proactive defences and cloud-assisted technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business provides greatly enhanced detection of malware 
 including protection against new threats that have not yet been recorded in signature databases.
Protects your systems from hacker attacks
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall 
 together with our Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) 
 helps to protect workstations and servers on your network
 to prevent intruders from accessing your systems and stealing or corrupting your business data.
Millions of other users
 all helping to protect your business
Many millions of Kaspersky users have 
opted in
 to let the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) automatically gather information about possible malware infections or suspicious behaviour from their systems. Over 25 million samples are received each day and this unparalleled level of intelligence from the field 
 received in real-time 
 enables Kaspersky
s experts to analyse new IT security threats and provide solutions more rapidly. Your business can fully benefit from this cloud-assisted capability
 even without you having to opt in.
Rapid to deploy
 and easy to manage
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE is preconfigured to start protecting your systems and data
 as soon as it
s installed. It
s also supplied complete with Kaspersky Security Center 
 the centralised management console that makes it easier for you to control all aspects of your Kaspersky security solution.
Flexible and scalable
You can tailor your Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE solution to meet your specific IT security needs. By adding one or more Kaspersky Targeted Security Solutions, you can add fully-integrated protection for storage, virtualisation, file servers, mobile devices, mail, Internet gateways or collaboration
 plus wide-ranging systems management capabilities.
Furthermore, whichever Kaspersky Targeted Security Solution you choose, you
ll still be able to manage your entire Kaspersky security via one integrated management console 
 Kaspersky Security Center.
In addition to award-winning anti-malware protection technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE also includes features that help to ease the load on your IT team.
Anti-malware for Workstations
Automatic and on-demand scanning
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business automatically scans files whenever they
re created, launched or modified. You can also run scans on demand 
 for individual files, directories, local disks or network disks.
Active Disinfection
Kaspersky Active Disinfection technology operates at the lowest levels of an operating system, to neutralise malicious objects.
Frequent updates and signature-based protection
Kaspersky issues malware database updates on a much more frequent basis than many other vendors. In addition, the use of pattern-based signatures helps to improve the detection of malicious files and also reduce the size of signature updates. Update optimisation helps to minimise the load on your CPUs, hard drives and communications bandwidth 
 so more of your computing resources are available for your business-critical applications.
Urgent Detection System
Kaspersky
s Urgent Detection System (UDS) database is updated with information about new malware before a signature has been created 
 to provide early and effective protection against new IT security threats.
Behavioural Analysis
Kaspersky
s System Watcher feature provides proactive protection, by analysing each program as the program is launched. It blocks the program if any suspicious behaviour is detected and it can also 
roll-back
 the system to a point before the malicious activity occurred.
Cloud-based protection
By gathering information about suspicious behaviour from millions of 
opted-in
 participants
 systems, the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) provides a more rapid response to new threats. Third-party tests show that KSN
s response time can be as fast as 0.02 seconds. In addition, KSN helps to reduce the risk of 
false positives
 
 to help ensure that only malicious software is identified
 so there
s less disruption to your day-to-day business activities.
Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) with Personal Firewall
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall protects endpoints from network threats, by controlling inbound and outbound traffic 
 according to the port, IP address, the application that is generating the traffic or other parameters. With predefined rules for over 250 of the most commonly used applications, Kaspersky also helps you to reduce the time taken to configure your firewall protection.
Network Attack Blocker
Network Attack Blocker tracks suspicious network activity. If an attempted attack is detected, Network Attack Blocker responds according to pre-defined criteria.
Unified Management Console
Centralised management console
Kaspersky Security Center is a centralised management console that makes it easier for administrators to set protection parameters, manage anti-malware updates and monitor security across their IT network.
Efficient use of your IT resources
Because the same Kaspersky team has developed all of Kaspersky
s prime technologies, your entire Kaspersky security solution is tightly integrated 
 for superior performance and easier management 
 and it places less load on your computing resources.
Support for a range of platforms
Kaspersky has developed endpoint security applications for Windows, Macintosh and Linux 
 so it
s easier for administrators to protect diverse networks.

opted in
 to let the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) automatically gather information about possible malware infections or suspicious behaviour from their systems. Over 25 million samples are received each day and this unparalleled level of intelligence from the field 
 received in real-time 
 enables Kaspersky
s experts to analyse new IT security threats and provide solutions more rapidly. Your business can fully benefit from this cloud-assisted capability
 even without you having to opt in.
Rapid to deploy
 and easy to manage
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE is preconfigured to start protecting your systems and data

Kaspersky Active Disinfection technology operates at the lowest levels of an operating system, to neutralise malicious objects.
Frequent updates and signature-based protection
Kaspersky issues malware database updates on a much more frequent basis than many other vendors. In addition, the use of pattern-based signatures helps to improve the detection of malicious files and also reduce the size of signature updates. Update optimisation helps to minimise the load on your CPUs, hard drives and communications bandwidth 
 so more of your computing resources are available for your business-critical applications.
Urgent Detection System
Kaspersky
s Urgent Detection System (UDS) database is updated with information about new malware before a signature has been created 
 to provide early and effective protection against new IT security threats.
Behavioural Analysis
Kaspersky
s System Watcher feature provides proactive protection, by analysing each program as the program is launched. It blocks the program if any suspicious behaviour is detected and it can also 
roll-back
 the system to a point before the malicious activity occurred.
Cloud-based protection
By gathering information about suspicious behaviour from millions of 
opted-in
 participants
 systems, the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) provides a more rapid response to new threats. Third-party tests show that KSN
s response time can be as fast as 0.02 seconds. In addition, KSN helps to reduce the risk of 
false positives
 
 to help ensure that only malicious software is identified
 so there
s less disruption to your day-to-day business activities.
Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) with Personal Firewall
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall protects endpoints from network threats, by controlling inbound and outbound traffic 
 according to the port, IP address, the application that is generating the traffic or other parameters. With predefined rules for over 250 of the most commonly used applications, Kaspersky also helps you to reduce the time taken to configure your firewall protection.
Network Attack Blocker
Network Attack Blocker tracks suspicious network activity. If an attempted attack is detected, Network Attack Blocker responds according to pre-defined criteria.
Unified Management Console

In addition to award-winning anti-malware protection technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE also includes features that help to ease the load on your IT team.
Anti-malware for Workstations
Automatic and on-demand scanning
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business automatically scans files whenever they
re created, launched or modified. You can also run scans on demand 
 for individual files, directories, local disks or network disks.
Active Disinfection
Kaspersky Active Disinfection technology operates at the lowest levels of an operating system, to neutralise malicious objects.
Frequent updates and signature-based protection
Kaspersky issues malware database updates on a much more frequent basis than many other vendors. In addition, the use of pattern-based signatures helps to improve the detection of malicious files and also reduce the size of signature updates. Update optimisation helps to minimise the load on your CPUs, hard drives and communications bandwidth 
 so more of your computing resources are available for your business-critical applications.
Urgent Detection System
Kaspersky
s Urgent Detection System (UDS) database is updated with information about new malware before a signature has been created 
 to provide early and effective protection against new IT security threats.
Behavioural Analysis
Kaspersky
s System Watcher feature provides proactive protection, by analysing each program as the program is launched. It blocks the program if any suspicious behaviour is detected and it can also 
roll-back
 the system to a point before the malicious activity occurred.
Cloud-based protection
By gathering information about suspicious behaviour from millions of 
opted-in
 participants
 systems, the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) provides a more rapid response to new threats. Third-party tests show that KSN
s response time can be as fast as 0.02 seconds. In addition, KSN helps to reduce the risk of 
false positives
 
 to help ensure that only malicious software is identified
 so there
s less disruption to your day-to-day business activities.
Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) with Personal Firewall
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall protects endpoints from network threats, by controlling inbound and outbound traffic 
 according to the port, IP address, the application that is generating the traffic or other parameters. With predefined rules for over 250 of the most commonly used applications, Kaspersky also helps you to reduce the time taken to configure your firewall protection.
Network Attack Blocker
Network Attack Blocker tracks suspicious network activity. If an attempted attack is detected, Network Attack Blocker responds according to pre-defined criteria.
Unified Management Console
Centralised management console
Kaspersky Security Center is a centralised management console that makes it easier for administrators to set protection parameters, manage anti-malware updates and monitor security across their IT network.
Efficient use of your IT resources
Because the same Kaspersky team has developed all of Kaspersky
s prime technologies, your entire Kaspersky security solution is tightly integrated 
 for superior performance and easier management 
 and it places less load on your computing resources.
Support for a range of platforms
Kaspersky has developed endpoint security applications for Windows, Macintosh and Linux 
 so it
s easier for administrators to protect diverse networks.

- Rigorous, multi-layer anti-malware protection;
- Single, unified anti-malware management console.
With over 125,000 new malicious programs being detected every day, relying on just signature-based protection is no longer enough to provide adequate security for your business Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE combines several powerful anti-malware technologies 
 including signature-based protection, proactive protection and cloud-assisted security 
 to deliver multiple layers of defence for your business.
Superior anti-malware
By combining signature-based detection, plus pattern-based, proactive defences and cloud-assisted technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business provides greatly enhanced detection of malware 
 including protection against new threats that have not yet been recorded in signature databases.
Protects your systems from hacker attacks
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall 
 together with our Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) 
 helps to protect workstations and servers on your network
 to prevent intruders from accessing your systems and stealing or corrupting your business data.
Millions of other users
 all helping to protect your business
Many millions of Kaspersky users have 
opted in
 to let the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) automatically gather information about possible malware infections or suspicious behaviour from their systems. Over 25 million samples are received each day and this unparalleled level of intelligence from the field 
 received in real-time 
 enables Kaspersky
s experts to analyse new IT security threats and provide solutions more rapidly. Your business can fully benefit from this cloud-assisted capability
 even without you having to opt in.
Rapid to deploy
 and easy to manage
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE is preconfigured to start protecting your systems and data
 as soon as it
s installed. It
s also supplied complete with Kaspersky Security Center 
 the centralised management console that makes it easier for you to control all aspects of your Kaspersky security solution.
Flexible and scalable
You can tailor your Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE solution to meet your specific IT security needs. By adding one or more Kaspersky Targeted Security Solutions, you can add fully-integrated protection for storage, virtualisation, file servers, mobile devices, mail, Internet gateways or collaboration
 plus wide-ranging systems management capabilities.
Furthermore, whichever Kaspersky Targeted Security Solution you choose, you
ll still be able to manage your entire Kaspersky security via one integrated management console 
 Kaspersky Security Center.
In addition to award-winning anti-malware protection technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE also includes features that help to ease the load on your IT team.
Anti-malware for Workstations
Automatic and on-demand scanning
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business automatically scans files whenever they
re created, launched or modified. You can also run scans on demand 
 for individual files, directories, local disks or network disks.
Active Disinfection
Kaspersky Active Disinfection technology operates at the lowest levels of an operating system, to neutralise malicious objects.
Frequent updates and signature-based protection
Kaspersky issues malware database updates on a much more frequent basis than many other vendors. In addition, the use of pattern-based signatures helps to improve the detection of malicious files and also reduce the size of signature updates. Update optimisation helps to minimise the load on your CPUs, hard drives and communications bandwidth 
 so more of your computing resources are available for your business-critical applications.
Urgent Detection System
Kaspersky
s Urgent Detection System (UDS) database is updated with information about new malware before a signature has been created 
 to provide early and effective protection against new IT security threats.
Behavioural Analysis
Kaspersky
s System Watcher feature provides proactive protection, by analysing each program as the program is launched. It blocks the program if any suspicious behaviour is detected and it can also 
roll-back
 the system to a point before the malicious activity occurred.
Cloud-based protection
By gathering information about suspicious behaviour from millions of 
opted-in
 participants
 systems, the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) provides a more rapid response to new threats. Third-party tests show that KSN
s response time can be as fast as 0.02 seconds. In addition, KSN helps to reduce the risk of 
false positives
 
 to help ensure that only malicious software is identified
 so there
s less disruption to your day-to-day business activities.
Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) with Personal Firewall
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall protects endpoints from network threats, by controlling inbound and outbound traffic 
 according to the port, IP address, the application that is generating the traffic or other parameters. With predefined rules for over 250 of the most commonly used applications, Kaspersky also helps you to reduce the time taken to configure your firewall protection.
Network Attack Blocker
Network Attack Blocker tracks suspicious network activity. If an attempted attack is detected, Network Attack Blocker responds according to pre-defined criteria.
Unified Management Console
Centralised management console
Kaspersky Security Center is a centralised management console that makes it easier for administrators to set protection parameters, manage anti-malware updates and monitor security across their IT network.
Efficient use of your IT resources
Because the same Kaspersky team has developed all of Kaspersky
s prime technologies, your entire Kaspersky security solution is tightly integrated 
 for superior performance and easier management 
 and it places less load on your computing resources.
Support for a range of platforms
Kaspersky has developed endpoint security applications for Windows, Macintosh and Linux 
 so it
s easier for administrators to protect diverse networks.

Endpoint Security for Business Core delivers:
- Rigorous, multi-layer anti-malware protection;
- Single, unified anti-malware management console.
With over 125,000 new malicious programs being detected every day, relying on just signature-based protection is no longer enough to provide adequate security for your business Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE combines several powerful anti-malware technologies 
 including signature-based protection, proactive protection and cloud-assisted security 
 to deliver multiple layers of defence for your business.
Superior anti-malware
By combining signature-based detection, plus pattern-based, proactive defences and cloud-assisted technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business provides greatly enhanced detection of malware 
 including protection against new threats that have not yet been recorded in signature databases.
Protects your systems from hacker attacks
Kaspersky
s advanced firewall 
 together with our Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) 
 helps to protect workstations and servers on your network
 to prevent intruders from accessing your systems and stealing or corrupting your business data.
Millions of other users
 all helping to protect your business
Many millions of Kaspersky users have 
opted in
 to let the cloud-based Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) automatically gather information about possible malware infections or suspicious behaviour from their systems. Over 25 million samples are received each day and this unparalleled level of intelligence from the field 
 received in real-time 
 enables Kaspersky
s experts to analyse new IT security threats and provide solutions more rapidly. Your business can fully benefit from this cloud-assisted capability
 even without you having to opt in.
Rapid to deploy
 and easy to manage
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE is preconfigured to start protecting your systems and data
 as soon as it
s installed. It
s also supplied complete with Kaspersky Security Center 
 the centralised management console that makes it easier for you to control all aspects of your Kaspersky security solution.
Flexible and scalable
You can tailor your Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE solution to meet your specific IT security needs. By adding one or more Kaspersky Targeted Security Solutions, you can add fully-integrated protection for storage, virtualisation, file servers, mobile devices, mail, Internet gateways or collaboration
 plus wide-ranging systems management capabilities.
Furthermore, whichever Kaspersky Targeted Security Solution you choose, you
ll still be able to manage your entire Kaspersky security via one integrated management console 
 Kaspersky Security Center.
In addition to award-winning anti-malware protection technologies, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business CORE also includes features that help to ease the load on your IT team.
Anti-malware for Workstations
Automatic and on-demand scanning
Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business automatically scans files whenever they
re created, launched or modified. You can also run scans on demand 
 for individual files, directories, local disks or network disks.
Active Disinfection
Kaspersky Active Disinfection technology operates at the lowest levels of an operating system, to neutralise malicious objects.
Frequent updates and signature-based protection
Kaspersky issues malware database updates on a much more frequent basis than many other vendors. In addition, the use of pattern-based signatures helps to improve the detection of malicious files and also reduce the size of signature updates. Update optimisation helps to minimise the load on your CPUs, hard drives and communications bandwidth 
 so more of your computing resources are available for your business-critical applications.
Urgent Detection System
Kaspersky
s Urgent Detection System (UDS) database is updated with information about new malware before a signature has been created 
 to provide early and effective protection against new IT security threats.
Behavioural Analysis
Kaspersky
s System Watcher feature provides proactive protection, by analysing each program as the program is launched. It blocks the program if any suspicious behaviour is detected and it can also 
roll-back
 the system to a point before the malicious activity occurred.
Cloud-based protection
By gathering information about suspicious behaviour from millions of 
opted-in
 participants
 systems, the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) provides a more rapid response to new threats. Third-party tests show that KSN
s response time can be as fast as 0.02 seconds. In addition, KSN helps to reduce the risk of 
false positives
 
 to help ensure that only malicious software is identified
 so there
s less disruption to your day-to-day business activities.
